hi,body
just one question
about set ept software breakpoint at R3
I need KeStackAttachProcess then create MDL Mapping view on virtual address in kernel mode
then call MmProbeAndLockPages lockup page memory
in VMcall to set ept breakpoint
It's that right?
So,tell me How does it find out what accesses the address and current register context information at After hitting the breakpoint
it should be EptViolationHandle\VmexitHandler or maybe VM exception
anyway, I mean which VM function can handle this breakpoint
Please get back to me. It means a lot to me
